Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Current             | 2021 |\n| Teneguía            | 1971 |\n| Nambroque           | 1949 |\n| El Charco           | 1712 |\n| Volcán San Antonio  | 1677 |\n| Volcán San Martin   | 1646 |\n| Tajuya near El Paso | 1585 |\n| Montaña Quemada     | 1492 |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
